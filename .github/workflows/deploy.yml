name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow deploys the prototype template to GitHub Pages.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
# 2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
# 3. Push to main branch to trigger deployment
#
# Note: This workflow will fail if Pages is not enabled. That's expected for
# the template repository. Enable Pages when you use this template for your project.
